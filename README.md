# Password Generator 
This webpage was developed with the intent of creating a randomized, secure password for users. The user can choose a password between 8-128 characters along with the optional use of lowercase and uppercase letters, numbers, and special characters. A few enhancements in the code have been included that enhance the overall user experience such as a copy to clipboard button. A condition was developed in order to avoid the user not receiving a password due to selecting cancel to the lowercase and uppercase letters, numbers, and special characters options. Should a user choose cancel to those options they will be provided with a password containing all special characters.
